# Mini-Filament-Factory
-A DIY Machine to produce 1.75mm filament from plastic pellets

3D printing is cheap nowadays, with the average 1kg PLA spool costing $10-20. But, can we make it even cheaper? The answer is yes, and that is what this project aims to achieve. This is a machine that can take in cheap plastic pellets, with PLA pellets costing $2-3 per kg, and output usable 3D printer filament.
