# Mini-Filament-Factory
-A DIY Machine to produce 1.75mm filament from plastic pellets

3D printing is cheap nowadays, with the average 1kg PLA spool costing $10-20. But, can we make it even cheaper? The answer is yes, and that is what this project aims to achieve. This is a machine that can take in cheap plastic pellets, with PLA pellets costing $2-3 per kg, and output usable 3D printer filament.

# Project Goals
1. Filament should be acceptable by a 3D Printer, and it should print well
2. Should be easy to build and run
3. Filament should be cheap to make
4. Handles multiple types of plastic
5. Resistant to jamming and other mechanical flaws

# Temporary:
Shopping cart photos for project review (I sent the wrong shopping cart photos for review) (Ignore the menards processing fee, since I will buy the parts in person)
