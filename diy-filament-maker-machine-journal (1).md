## 12/3/2025 - Preliminary Concept  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I looked at industrial and DIY filament machine designs to find some ideas/inspiration. Eventually, I came up with a simple working diagram for the machine. I plan on laying the machine out in a line, like an assembly line. Now that I have the concept laid down, the next thing is to fire up CAD (onshape) and start making an actual design.![image (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgwNjcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e8b4937f0bc79f13258c55f4df530cd6c86d58ba/image%20(1).png)
  

## 12/4/2025 - Created Motor Mount & Gearbox  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

In the last journal, I created a preliminary concept that showed how the machine would function. The screw conveyer will be an auger screw that will be driven by a drive mechanism. So today, I made the drive mechanism. I had a 4200W 4092 1050kv Hobbystar motor lying around at home, so I decided to base my design off of that. I researched planetary gears, and after a few hiccups I was able to create a perfectly meshing planetary gearbox. It has a gear ratio of 3125:1 and is in the planetary arrangement (Stationary ring). To drive the motor, I will be using a Sequre 28120 AM32 ESC running at 32V. The motor RPM will be 33600(kV * V => 1050*32) when it is running at max voltage. The gearbox will output around 10.7RPM (RPM/Gear Ratio => 33600/3125) which should be enough to drive the screw conveyer.

## 12/6/2025 - Redesigned the Planetary Gearbox  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

In the last journal entry, I created a motor mount and planetary gearbox. I was just looking over the design, and I noticed that the dimensions of the gears in the gearbox aren't thick enough to support the loads that it needs to. So, I went in and deleted the old 3125:1 gearbox and created a new design. This time, I made sure to make the gears thick enough to handle the loads. I also reduced the gear ratio down to 10:10:10, or 1:1000. This way, the output will have a higher RPM range, being from 0 to 33.6. The cad design and assembly both took an hour, which is less than the time it took for the first gearbox (this time I had some experience from making the old design). ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAxMjUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d4a8864b07b76354db93803cb23fe1885265d8ab/image.png)

## 12/8/2025 - Finished Filament Diameter Sensor  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

To get usable filament, we need to make sure that the filament is accurate to +-0.1mm in diameter. To achieve this, we need something that senses the diameter of the filament and sends commands to the puller mechanism ahead. If the diameter is too small, the puller will pull slower, and vice versa. The filament goes through the middle two bearings on the top. The gap between the two bearings is the wanted diameter, 1.75mm. The top bearing is connected to a lever arm, with its fulcrum (rotation point) being another bearing. The lever arm has an amplification ratio of ~4.8. This means that if the filament diameter changes by .1mm, the magnet at the bottom will move by .48mm. The magnet at the bottom interacts with a SS94E hall effect sensor, which senses the changes in magnetic field. As the magnet moves, the hall effect sensor will pick that up and send it to the Arduino, which will do calculations to adjust the puller speed as needed. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0NzAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--2c5f0857632afd7a7950bb63e3db015642e49dfc/image.png)

## 12/9/2025 2 PM - Finished Puller Mechanism  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

The filament comes out of the nozzle bigger or smaller than the desired diameter. To solve this problem, a pulling mechanism needs to be used that pulls the filament based on the filament diameter. This mechanism uses 2 wheels that are driven by nema17 stepper motors. Using stepper motors allows precise control over the speed of the rollers. The bottom stepper motor is fixed to the base, while the top one can move up and down. A nut is attached to the top stepper motor, which is attached to a rotatable bolt. The bolt is connected to a reduction gear so it can be moved in very small increments. ![17653095165154617505062771031728](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE3OTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b4c68cfb6a6163d8ea853ccf2ac06e5e50fb93ef/17653095165154617505062771031728.jpg)
  

## 12/9/2025 10 PM - Created Fan Mount, Extruder, & Finalized Design  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I made the final two pieces of the puzzle: the extruder and fan mount. The extruder has a hopper in the back that takes in plastic pellets. The stainless-steel pipe has a rectangular opening of 20x20mm. The pipe and the auger have an inside diameter of 25mm. The pipe will have to be slightly shaved down by ~.3-.4mm to allow the auger to rotate but also prevent backflow (the molten plastic shouldn't flow back through the gap between the auger and pipe). At the end, there is a cap with a 2mm hole, which is where the filament comes out of. The auger is coupled to the gearbox in the back using a hex coupling. There are 4 90x25mm fans that blow at different parts of the assembly. The first one blows at the joint between the auger shaft and the PLA gearbox output shaft, so that the 3D printed part doesn't soften due to heat. The 2nd fan blows between the cold and hot sections of the barrel, so that the plastic pellets can enter the screw conveyer and travel to the end without sticking. The last 100mm section of the pipe has two 150W 30x50mm band heaters which can heat up to 400*C. The last 2 fans blow at the filament exiting the nozzle to cool and harden the outer layer. The entire assembly will be screwed into a base piece of wood. The next and final step before getting to building hands on will be creating the electrical systems.

## 12/10/2025 8 PM - Changed Drive Mechanism  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

The planetary gearbox and the 4200W motor I was using earlier was super overkill for what it was meant for, and it was very expensive. So, I switched over to using a Nema 23 stepper motor with a TB6600 driver, which is a lot more accurate, is a lot cheaper, and is also meant for this purpose. Choosing the motor and driver took most of the time, as designing the mount for it in CAD was easy.

## 12/10/2025 10 PM - Finalized electrical systems and machine assembly  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I spent some time completing the basic wiring diagram for the machine and finalized the assembly in Onshape. The electrical systems will be powered by the wall outlet and a bench power supply. After I did that, I went over the BOM and made sure everything was there and got the project ready for the 1st review.![Circuit Block (2)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIzNzAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--406b3e830d3ed3f232cf099fb1a332aa8bbb99f8/Circuit%20Block%20(2).png)

## 12/17/2025 - Reduced motor sizes on extruder & minor changes to puller  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

To save costs, I downsized the extruder motor from a NEMA 23 to a NEMA 17. A Nema 17 on its own won't supply the torque needed to turn the 25MM auger and overcome the pressure required to push the plastic forward, so I will pair it with a 10:1 planetary gearbox that is beefy enough to handle axial loads. The puller motors still use the same Nema 17 Pancake motor (smaller version of a NEMA 17 - used in 3D printer extruders), but only 1 instead of 2. The 2nd roller is now an idler bearing. The idler bearing can move up and down by rotating the small gear, which turns the big gear at a 5:1 ratio, which turns a bolt. The bolt has 13 threads per inch, so a full rotation of the small gear will move the idler bearing .4mm up or down. I could use Nema 14 motors for the puller, but I couldn't find any on AliExpress that are cheaper than my Nema 17s, and they would bring up other issues, so I just stuck with the old configuration. Any motor smaller than a Nema 14 won't supply enough torque to pull the filament strand through the machine, and it won't run for long without overheating or slipping (e.g., a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor). Reliability will drop with smaller motors, and reliability is super important for making a consistent 1.75mm filament. The circular-to-hex coupling (gearbox to auger) will probably be 3D printed, or I will find another solution to it. The hex dimensions aren't specified in the seller's listing, and a hex-to-circular coupling with the appropriate dimensions is rare. Therefore, 3D printing it will likely be the best option.

## 1/2/2026 - Added Info to ReadMe and Created Base Firmware  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I updated the ReadMe with wiring diagrams and an explanation of the machine. I created some basic code for the entire machine. The code uses PID modulation twice to control temperature of the band heater and puller speed to control the filament diameter.
